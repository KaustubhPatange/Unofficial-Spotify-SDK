# Unofficial-Spotify-SDK

# ⚠️ Underconstruction ⚠️

The library provides a wrapper over **spotify-auth** api (which is a part of [official-sdk](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk)) to handle _automatic authentication_ as well as to yield some certain routes provided by [web-api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/).

> _Note: The library does not include Spotify sdk internally, you will need to add it manually which will be covered in wiki guides._

## Why need this?

- Drawback of not providing a built-in way to refresh access token.

Well if you've used official android sdk, you know there are lot's of issue with the api being the major one is not providing a way to refresh a token.
